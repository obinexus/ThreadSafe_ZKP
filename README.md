# ThreadSafe_ZKP

> **Thread-Safe Zero-Knowledge Proof Framework with Quantum-Resistant Governance**

ThreadSafe_ZKP is a research and implementation framework that integrates **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)**, **thread-safe concurrency patterns**, and **post-quantum lattice-based cryptography** into a unified system. This repository contains formal models, implementations, and documentation for building secure, scalable, and governance-aware cryptographic systems.

---

## ?? Overview

ThreadSafe_ZKP bridges three critical domains:

1. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** - Privacy-preserving authentication without exposing secrets
2. **Thread-Safe Concurrency** - Data-oriented parallel processing with formal safety guarantees
3. **Quantum-Resistant Identity** - Lattice-based cryptographic systems resistant to quantum attacks

The framework is built around the **Gosilang polyglot runtime** and the **Rift governance model**, enabling systems that are both mathematically verifiable and practically deployable.

// Basic thread-safe counter with geometric proof
@thread_safe(isolation="serializable")
actor ThreadSafeCounter {
    value: int = 0
    
    fn increment() -> (int, ok) {
        // Atomic operation with proof
        new_value = atomic_add(&self.value, 1)
        return (new_value, ok)
    }
}
```

```gosilang
// Bank account with event sourcing and governance
@aggregate_root(type="event_sourced")
actor BankAccount {
    // Events: AccountOpened, MoneyDeposited, MoneyWithdrawn
    // Commands with governance validation
    // Full audit trail with geometric proofs
}
```

### 3. Zero-Knowledge Authentication
```gosilang
// ZKP-based authentication without password exposure
